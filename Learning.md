# drag and drop events:
          - on dragstart
          - on drag
          - on dragend

# relative paths:
     - "/" is the root path. (absolute path)
     - "" or "./" is the current directory. (relative path)
     - "../" is the parent directory. (relative path)

# Utility classes:
     .util-cls {
          something: value;
     }
    (the point of utility class is add it to any element and it will apply the style to that element. this is important because it makes the code more maintainable and reusable.)
